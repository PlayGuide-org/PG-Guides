    <p>The guide you need to get started with Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.</p>

    <p class="has-text-align-center"> <p>The
        game is a multiplayer online battle arena, commonly shortened to MOBA. 
       Two teams of five players go against each other in real-time to try to 
       achieve victory.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s
        easy to get into and with its huge player base, matchmaking lasts about
        10 seconds, allowing players to quickly jump into a game.&nbsp;Battles 
       last about 10 minutes, though, and they can last longer if you’re in a 
       more intense game.</p> <p>Once you’re ready to jump in, here’s a beginner’s guide to <em>MLBB</em>.&nbsp;</p> <h2>How to win</h2> <p>Taking
        down the opposing base is the main goal to achieve victory. You’ll need
        teamwork and strategy to accomplish this. To better understand this, 
       you need to get familiar with the map in <em>MLBB</em>.&nbsp;</p><img src="https://dotesports.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/02215603/map-1024x476.jpg" alt="Your Image" width="100%"> <p>There
        are three lanes in the game. The gold lane (top), EXP lane (bottom), 
       and the mid lane. Between each lane is the jungle. If you’re getting 
       confused, these terms will be explained a bit later. </p> <p>Depending 
       on what side of the map (blue or red) you start on, the lanes will be in
        a different position. A good way of knowing this is by locating the 
       turtle on the map. If the turtle is at the bottom, then you are on the 
       blue side. If the turtle is at the top, then you’re on the red side and 
       the lanes are rotated. </p> <p>To win, you need to take down a total of 
       nine turrets that stand in your way, three in each lane. These serve as 
       important defensive positions for both you and your opponents. You can’t
        attack the enemy base directly without taking down all the opposing 
       turrets in at least one lane first.</p> <h2>Lanes</h2> <p>Before you 
       jump into a game to destroy turrets, it’s important to understand the 
       lanes. There are three lanes: gold, mid, and EXP.&nbsp;</p> <p>You can’t
        directly attack an enemy turret alone. These turrets shoot at champions
        and deal a ton of damage. To attack them without taking damage, you 
       need the help of your team’s minions.&nbsp;</p> <p>Minions spawn at the 
       teams’ bases and travel down along each lane. You need to take down the 
       enemy minions to let your minions take the damage from the turret while 
       you attack it.&nbsp;</p><img src="https://dotesports.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/02215628/minion-1024x572.png" alt="Your Image" width="100%"> <p>If
        you destroy all three turrets in a lane, your base will start spawning 
       super minions, which are much stronger and deal more damage.&nbsp;</p> <p>Be
        careful while attacking turrets, though. You don’t want to get caught 
       by an enemy hero and get killed. It’s important to make sure that the 
       enemy hero in your lane is dead or in another area of the map (use the 
       mini-map) before engaging on a turret.&nbsp;</p> <p>Remember, getting 
       kills isn’t the main goal of the game. While it grants you experience 
       and gold to make your hero stronger, the main focus is always destroying
        the enemy base.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Jungle</h2> <p>The jungle is the space 
       between the lanes. It can be divided into four parts: two between the 
       enemy’s lanes and two between your team’s lanes. The jungle has 
       different creeps and monsters that offer buffs, experience, and gold. 
       While there are many intricacies of the jungle in <em>MLBB</em>, they can be roughly divided into the following.</p> <ul><li>Blue
        buffs: Killing the serpent in the jungle will give you the blue buff 
       (also called the purple buff). This buff grants the hero a cooldown 
       reduction and reduces the cost of mana and energy.&nbsp;</li><li>Red 
       buff: Killing the Fiend in the jungle will give the hero a red buff 
       (also called orange buff). This will deal more attack damage and slow 
       down enemies when they’re attacked.&nbsp;</li><li>Other creeps: The 
       other creeps in the jungle will give you gold and experience. These will
        allow you to scale up your hero and help out in the lanes. Thus, 
       killing them is also important.&nbsp;</li></ul><img src="https://dotesports.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/02215659/creeps-1024x574.png" alt="Your Image" width="100%"><ul><li>Turtle:
        The Turtle spawns at the two-minute mark on one side of the river. It 
       has high health, so it’s better to take it down with your team. It gives
        the entire team gold and EXP. The turtle is the first objective teams 
       will fight over on the map. Thus, early teamfights are likely to happen 
       around it.&nbsp;</li></ul><img src="https://dotesports.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/02220555/turtle-1024x576.jpg" alt="Your Image" width="100%"> <ul><li>Lord: The most important monster in <em>MLBB </em>is
        the Lord. It spawns on the opposite side of the river to the Turtle. It
        joins the team that defeats it to storm down the lane and destroy enemy
        turrets.&nbsp;</li></ul><img src="https://dotesports.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/02215951/lord-1024x569.png" alt="Your Image" width="100%"> <h2>Roles</h2> <p>Once you’ve gotten a feel for the map, you need to learn about the roles in <em>MLBB </em>before hopping into a game.</p> <p>There are over 110 heroes in <em>MLBB</em>,
        each of which have different abilities. Usually, each hero comes with 
       three abilities and a passive. The last of three abilities is the 
       ultimate, an extremely powerful ability that’s unlocked later in the 
       game and has a longer cooldown.&nbsp;</p> <img src="https://dotesports.com/wp-content/uploads/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/02220608/screen-4-1024x576.jpg" alt="Your Image" width="100%"><p>For a game like <em>MLBB</em>,
        teamwork is vital to winning. Thus, each hero has different roles 
       depending on whether they have to jungle or play in a lane. The heroes 
       are split into six categories or roles. These are:</p> <h3>Tank</h3> <ul><li>Heroes
        in this category are bulky and have higher health but deal lower 
       damage. Their main goal is to lead the charge into the enemies since 
       their high health enables them to last longer in teamfights. Their 
       abilities also usually offer some crowd control. This could be a 
       pushback, stun, or slow.&nbsp;</li><li>Position: Tanks are usually played in the EXP lane.</li></ul> <h3>Assassin</h3> <ul><li>An
        assassin is the opposite of a tank. They have low health but deal high 
       damage. It’s one of the tougher roles to master since positioning is 
       extremely important.&nbsp;</li><li>Position: Assassins are good in the jungle.&nbsp;</li></ul>  <h3>Fighter</h3> <ul><li>Fighters
        are sort of in the middle of an assassin and a tank. While they don’t 
       have high damage or health, these heroes excel in the late game after 
       scaling up. In the late game, they can take up the role of a tank or 
       even an assassin.&nbsp;</li><li>Position: They’re best used in the EXP lane.&nbsp;</li></ul> <h3>Marksman</h3> <ul><li>Marksmen
        are like assassins, but they deal damage from a distance. They’re more 
       dependent on their basic attacks and can take down enemies from 
       afar.&nbsp;</li><li>Position: They’re used in the gold lane.&nbsp;</li></ul> <h3>Mage</h3> <ul><li>Unlike
        the marksmen, mages don’t deal high damage with their basic attacks. 
       Instead, they focus on their abilities. Their abilities are different 
       and add variety to teamfights.&nbsp;</li><li>Position: Mages are usually used in the mid lane.&nbsp;</li></ul> <h3>Support</h3> <ul><li>Similar
        to the tank, the role of the support is to aid and take damage for the 
       team. Their abilities usually consist of something that can help the 
       team, which may even be a heal. While they don’t take many kills, the 
       crucial support that they offer can turn teamfights and matches 
       around.&nbsp;</li><li>Position: They’re used for supporting the marksman or the mage in the gold or mid lane.&nbsp;</li></ul> <h2>Beginner-friendly heroes</h2> <p>It’s
        best to master a single role while becoming familiar with another one 
       in case someone else in your match selects it. Here are some easy 
       champions for each role to get you started.&nbsp;</p> <ul><li>Tanks: Tigreal and Grock</li><li>Assassin: Hanzo and Karina</li><li>Fighter: Roger and Zilong</li><li>Marksmen: Miya and Layla</li><li>Mage: Eudora and Nana</li><li>Support: Estes and Angela</li></ul> <h2>Terminology</h2> <p>There are a lot of terms in <em>MLBB</em>.
        You’ll become more familiar with them later on after getting a bit of 
       experience. Initially, here are a few terms to know before hopping into a
        game.&nbsp;</p> <ul><li>AFK: It stands for away from the keyboard. 
       Originally stemming from PC games, it’s now used to denote that a player
        is offline.&nbsp;</li><li>Rotation: A rotation means to move from one position of a map to another.&nbsp;</li><li>Stunned: When a hero is stunned, they’re immobilized and can’t attack or use their skills.&nbsp;</li><li>Airborne: Similar to stun, the hero is thrown into the air and can’t attack or run away.&nbsp;</li><li>Silenced: When a hero is silenced, it means they can’t use their abilities.&nbsp;</li><li>Battle
        spells: These are special spells that can be selected before a match. 
       They can give heroes a shield or heal them when used.&nbsp;</li></ul> <p><em>MLBB</em>,
        just like any other MOBA, is a highly strategic game. Even the biggest 
       stars who will compete in the M3 World Championship started where you 
       are right now. The best way to learn is by hopping into games and 
       gradually picking up skills along the way.&nbsp;</p> </div>
